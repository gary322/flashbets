## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to achieve $100+ daily profits with $10,000 starting capital on the betting platform. Based on Part 7 specifications and implemented features.

## Strategy 1: Arbitrage Trading ($150-300/day potential)

### How It Works
Exploit price differences between our platform and Polymarket for risk-free profits.

### Implementation
```
Capital Required: $10,000
Daily Profit Target: $150-300 (1.5-3%)
Risk Level: Very Low
```

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Monitor Price Discrepancies**
   - Use the price monitoring tool to track markets
   - Look for >2% price differences between platforms
   - Focus on high-volume markets for better liquidity

2. **Execute Arbitrage**
   ```
   Example Trade:
   - Platform A: "Trump wins" at 45% ($0.45)
   - Our Platform: "Trump wins" at 48% ($0.48)
   - Action: Buy on Platform A, Sell on our platform
   - Profit: $0.03 per share (6.25% gross)
   - After fees (0.3%): ~5.95% net profit
   ```

3. **Optimal Trade Sizing**
   - Use 20% of capital per trade ($2,000)
   - Execute 5-10 trades daily
   - Average profit per trade: 2-3% after fees
   - Daily profit: $200-300

### Tools Provided
- Real-time price feed integration
- Automated arbitrage detector
- One-click execution for speed

## Strategy 2: Market Making ($80-150/day potential)

### How It Works
Provide liquidity to markets and earn from spreads + MMT rewards.

### Implementation
```
Capital Required: $10,000
Daily Profit Target: $80-150 (0.8-1.5%)
Risk Level: Low-Medium
```

### Profitable Market Selection
1. **High Volume Binary Markets**
   - Politics, sports, crypto price predictions
   - Look for >$100k daily volume
   - Spread opportunities: 1-2%

2. **Multi-Outcome Markets (3-5 outcomes)**
   - More spread opportunities
   - Less competition from bots
   - Average spread: 2-3%

### Execution Strategy
```
Example: "Biden approval >50% by EOY"
- Set buy orders at 48.5%
- Set sell orders at 51.5%
- Capture 3% spread on each round trip
- Volume: $20k/day → $600 in spreads
- Your share (with $2k liquidity): ~$120
```

### MMT Token Bonus

- 15% fee rebate on all trades
- Additional staking rewards: 10-20% APY

## Strategy 3: Volatility Harvesting ($100-200/day potential)

### How It Works
Trade on volatility spikes during news events.

### Target Events
1. **Political Announcements**
   - Polls releases (3pm EST daily)
   - Policy announcements
   - Debate performances

2. **Economic Data**
   - Fed decisions
   - Employment reports
   - Inflation data

### Trading Pattern
```
Pre-Event Setup:
1. Identify binary market tied to event
2. Current price: 50%
3. Buy straddle position:
   - $5k on YES at 50% 
   - $5k on NO at 50%
4. Wait for volatility spike

Post-Event:
- Price moves to 65% or 35%
- Close winning position at profit
- Let losing position expire or hedge
- Net profit: 15-30% of movement
```

## Strategy 4: Chain Trading Optimization ($50-100/day potential)

### How It Works
Execute optimized chain trades across correlated markets.

### Example Chain
```
Market A: "Fed raises rates" (60%)
Market B: "USD strengthens" (55%)
Market C: "Gold drops" (45%)

Chain Logic: A → B → NOT C
Capital: $10,000
Expected profit: 5-8% when correlation plays out
```

### Daily Execution
- Identify 2-3 high-probability chains
- Allocate $3-4k per chain
- Target 2-3% profit per chain
- Daily profit: $60-120

## Strategy 5: Bootstrap Phase Exploitation ($200-500/day for first 30 days)
