# LEVERAGE TRADING RISK DISCLOSURE

## HIGH RISK WARNING

Trading with leverage involves substantial risk and is not suitable for all traders. You may lose more than your initial investment. Before engaging in leveraged trading, you must understand and accept the following risks:

### 1. LEVERAGE AMPLIFIES LOSSES
- With 10x leverage, a 10% adverse price movement results in 100% loss
- With 50x leverage, a 2% adverse price movement results in 100% loss  
- With 100x leverage, a 1% adverse price movement results in 100% loss
- Chain positions can achieve up to 500x effective leverage

### 2. LIQUIDATION RISK
- Positions are subject to automatic liquidation when losses exceed collateral
- Partial liquidation reduces position size gradually but can still result in total loss
- Market volatility can cause rapid liquidations with no opportunity to add collateral

### 3. FUNDING RATE COSTS
- Funding rates are amplified by leverage amount
- High leverage positions incur proportionally higher funding costs
- During market halts, funding rates accumulate at +1.25% per hour

### 4. CROSS-MARGIN RISKS
- Profitable positions can be used to offset losses in other positions
- All positions in cross-margin are at risk if one position experiences large losses
- Total account liquidation is possible with cross-margin

### 5. TECHNICAL RISKS
- Network congestion may prevent timely order execution
- Price oracle delays can impact position valuations
- Smart contract risks exist despite audits

### 6. MARKET RISKS
- Extreme volatility can cause immediate liquidations
- Low liquidity can result in high slippage
- Market manipulation can trigger stop losses and liquidations

### 7. CHAIN POSITION RISKS
- Chain positions compound leverage across multiple markets
- A single losing leg terminates the entire chain
- Maximum potential losses equal your entire stake
