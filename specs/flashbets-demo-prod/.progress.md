# Progress

## Current

- **Phase**: implement
- **Task**: 2.2 UI quality gates (clean checkout)
- **Status**: in progress

## Original goal

Make flashbets demo fully working end-to-end, with green CI and deployable on GitHub.

## Completed

- Duration config parsing stabilized via `humantime-serde`.
- Middleware/connect-info handling stabilized for tests.
- Rust test matrix passes locally (root + api_runner + flash_bets program).
- Removed accidental duplicate/untracked security files.

## Learnings

- Running in iCloud Drive can corrupt/timeout Node toolchain reads; use a clean checkout/worktree under `/tmp` for Node + E2E validation.
- Some tests require localhost binding; run them outside the sandbox when validating locally.

## Blockers

- Node toolchain in iCloud path has corrupted `node_modules` wrappers (e.g., `tsc`); validate UI/E2E from a clean checkout under `/tmp`.

## Next steps

1. Create a clean `/tmp` worktree checkout and run UI gates (`npm ci`, type-check, lint, build).
2. Run Playwright E2E smoke from the clean checkout.
3. Commit and push to `git@github.com:gary322/flashbets.git`, then confirm CI is green.
