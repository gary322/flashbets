# Progress

## Current

- **Phase**: release
- **Task**: 3.3 Confirm CI green
- **Status**: completed

## Original goal

Make flashbets demo fully working end-to-end, with green CI and deployable on GitHub.

## Completed

- Duration config parsing stabilized via `humantime-serde`.
- Middleware/connect-info handling stabilized for tests.
- Rust test matrix passes locally (root + api_runner + flash_bets program).
- UI quality gates pass (`npm ci`, type-check, lint, build).
- E2E demo stack + Playwright smoke passes.
- CI is green on GitHub Actions (run `21756369114` on commit `1905da3`).
- Root workspace CI stabilized by reducing linker memory and avoiding `solana_program::msg!` in host-only code.

## Learnings

- Running in iCloud Drive can corrupt/timeout Node toolchain reads; use a clean checkout/worktree under `/tmp` for Node + E2E validation.
- Some tests require localhost binding; run them outside the sandbox when validating locally.
- Host tests can indirectly trip Solana program-test syscall stubs; avoid `msg!` in code paths used by normal unit tests.

## Blockers

- None.

## Next steps

1. Optional: add a hosted demo deploy (Vercel/Render/Fly) if you want a public URL.
